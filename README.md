# Restaurent_Reveneu_prediction
Based on provided data,I have created a Machine Learning Model to predict restaurant revenue....lets explore it 
* I have explored different types of regression model for the data set.
* With taking collineared features gives :
  *  The MAE with the DT regressor is: 1983498.3095238095
  *  The MsE with the DT regressor is: 7514304866259.357
  *  The R2_Score with the DT regressor is: -1.18034336261988

* Without taking collineared features gives:
  * The MAE with the linear regressor is: 2241874.2820063164
  *The MsE with the linear regressor is: 10099697271287.938
  *The R2_Score with the linear regressor is: -1.9305182983459108
  
  
So,among linear regression model, 'With taking collineared features' is good,as it gives good result.
**But,among all above discussed model,Random Forest model gives best result**
